### SPEED TEST
- population storage
    - creating thread arrays
- population abstraction
    - multidimension array of integers
    - multidimension array of node objects
    - array of individual objects
    - priorty queue
- encoding (last)
    - single permuation for all operations
    - one permutation for 2 and 1 operations
    - different permuation for each operation
- sorting
    - exact fitness
        - by pointers
        - by whole object
    - estimated fitness
        - by pointers
        - by whole objects


### QUALITY TEST
- crossover
    - resolution
    - operators
        - tournament
        - roulette
    - selection
        - random
        - fitess
        - both random and fitess
- mutation
    - resolution
    - operators
      - inverse
      - scrambled
- replacement
    - inplace of population array
    - seperate children and parent array
- two opt frequency
- migration frequenecy
- fitness metrics
    - euclidean
    - squared distances


### REMARKS
- store functions frequently used together, together
- store variables frequently used together, together
- use vector operations
- caching
- lookup tables
- see which mathematic operation is done most
- profile code
    - investigate clock cycles
